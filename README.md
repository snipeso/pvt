# Biword

## Todo

- represent chosen word at the end
- make timing based on triggers
- adjust timings in configurations properly

With Simone:

- center text stims properly
- get key presses to work
- figure out what psychopy does with psychtoolbox, maybe faster?
- make function keep track of ALL key presses, and error if pressed out of turn
